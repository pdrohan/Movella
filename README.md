# Kaggle Hockey Goalie Dataset

This is a Python Library for some data analysis I did on a Kaggle Hockey Goalie Dataset. This is the updated branch as I reformatted some logic. 
Note this generates an HTML file of a dataframe for ease of viewing, do not be alarmed when it is opened.

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository 
2. Run the pip command


```bash
pip install -e .
```

## Usage
3. Run the test command
```bash
pytest

```
4. Run the file however you like

## Output
There should be a printed output (shown below) as well as an HTML file opened.

The Most Goals Stopped by any Goalie:
-> {'playerID': 'brodema01', 'goals_stopped': 29915.0}

The Most Efficient Goalie:
-> {'playerID': 'mioed01', 'efficiency': 28.23}
